# Data types in python

# String e.g "Hello world"
# Float e.g 3.142
# Integer e.g positive and negative numbers
# Boolean e.g True or False

# The process of getting the position in a string is called subscripting
# e.g - name = "Moses"
# print(name[0]) - This prints the first character in the string
